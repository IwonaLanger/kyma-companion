# Administration and Operations in the Kyma Environment

This is the managed offering of SAP BTP, Kyma runtime \(based on the open-source project "Kyma"\). The administrators of the Kyma environment take care of setting it up and make sure it is ready for developers to work with. Create your Kyma instance to build applications and extensions to SAP and third-party solutions, manage roles, have your Kubernetes objects backed up, and view metrics and logs.

> ### Caution:  
> Do not make changes in any Kyma-managed namespaces, the *<kube-system\>* namespace, or to any resources marked with *Do Not Edit*. Changes to those resources could lead to exclusion or disruptions from the agreed SLA. If you decide to make changes despite this, consult support in advance, and proceed with caution.
